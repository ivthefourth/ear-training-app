## About
A web app made to help audio engineers train their ears. This app uses the concept of reference mixing (A/B mixing) so that users practice correcting subtle differences between two similar audio signals. Other ear training programs focus more on detecting a difference or memorizing the sound of various frequency ranges, but this app combines the skill of perception with the practical application of equalization. 

This app will work on browsers that support the Web Audio API and is mobile responsive (mobile has only been tested in Safari so far).

### Dev Notes 
* wa_resources.js needs to be built from files in js-resources folder based on order.txt. I need to add a build tool if I make updates, because the old one was in the portfolio repo, where this was originally made.
* want to clean up and comment js
* want to improve ui controls so that going beyond boundries brings controls to max/min values as appropriate 
* want to improve accessibility
